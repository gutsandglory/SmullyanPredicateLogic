# SmullyanPredicateLogic - a solver for logic puzzles #

This is an example of how certain logic Puzzles can be solved using a model checker for monadic predicate logic with identity. Specifically it has been written to solve some of the puzzles in Chapter VIII of Raymond Smullyan's book *The Riddle of Scheherazade*.

A series of articles explaining how the solver works can be found here: [Solving Logic Puzzles Automatically (With Swift)](https://medium.com/@sorenlind/solving-logic-puzzles-automatically-with-swift-part-1-544ef57b7f11).
